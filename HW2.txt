1.
	p1	= (10, 20)
	p2	= (30, 40)
	v 	= <30-10, 40-20>
		= <20, 20>

	a. Parametric form:
		x(t)= 10 + 20t 
		y(t)= 20 + 20t

	b. Implicit form:
		x - y = -10	
	
	c. distance between the line and 
		q	= (22, 29)

		m 	= 1
		The distance line connecting q and the line will be orthogonal to the line, which means the slope will be the inverse of m.
		md 	= -1
		The equation of the line passing through q and orthogonal to the line (along which the shortest path will be traced) is
		y 	= 51 - x
		The intersection of these two lines is as follows:
		x - (51 - x) = -10
		2x 	= 41
		x 	= 41/2
		y 	= 61/2
		r 	= (41/2, 61/2)
		The distance from q->r is as follows:
		dx 	= 22-41/2 	= 3/2
		dy	= 29-61/2	= -3/2
		d 	= sqrt((3/2)^2 + (-3/2)^2)	= sqrt(9/2)
		d 	= 2.121320344

	d. does closest point on line and q fall between p1 and p2?

2.	Circle:
	c 	= (10, 12)
	r 	= 3
	(x-10)^2 + (y-12)^2 = 9

	a. Is the following point in the circle?
		q 	= (12, 13)
		If q is inside the circle, the following will hold true:
			(x-10)^2 + (y-12)^2 < 9

		(12-10)^2 + (13-12)^2 < 9
		4 + 1 < 9
		true

		Alternatively, the distance of q from c:
			= sqrt((13-12)^2 + (12-10)^2)
			= sqrt(1 + 4)
			r = 3 = sqrt(9) > sqrt(5)

			Because the distance from q to c is shorter than the radius, the point falls within the circle.

	b. Closest point on circle to
		q	= (20, 15)

		To find the closest point on the circle p, I will find the line connecting c and q, then find the point p on that line that is a distance of r from c toward q.

		m 	= 3/10
		y 	= (3/10)x + 9

		x / 10 = 3 / sqrt(109)
		x 	= 30 / sqrt(109) + 10
			= 12.873478856
		y / 3  = 3 / sqrt(109)
		y 	= 9 / sqrt(109) + 12
			= 12.862043657

		p 	= (12.873478856, 12.862043657)

3.	Ellipse
	c 	= (10, 12)
	w 	= 20		(30, 12), (-10, 12)
	h 	= 10		(10, 22), (10, 2)
	(x-10)^2/400 + (x-12)^2/100 = 1

	a. Is the following point in the ellipse?
		q 	= (19, 13)
		If q is inside the ellipse, the following will hold true:
			(x-10)^2/400 + (x-12)^2/100 < 1

		(19-10)^2/400 + (13-12)^2/100 < 1
		81/400 + 4/400 < 1
		true

	b. Corners of bounding box
		(30, 22), (30, 2), (-10, 22), (-10, 2)

4.	Square
	l 	= 10
	c 	= (60, 80)

	Is the following point in the square?
		q 	= (64, 74)
		If q is in the square, its x coordinate will be bounded by the vertical walls of the square and its y coordinate will be bounded by the horizontal walls of the square.

		Horizontal walls: x = 55, x = 65
		55 < 64 < 65
		true

		Vertical walls: y = 75, y = 85
		75 < 74, 85
		false

		Because both conditions were not satisfied, q is not in the square.

5. Triangle
	p1 	= (10, 20)
	p2 	= (30, 40)
	p3	= (20, 50)

	Is the following point in the triangle?
		p	= (20, 40)

		If q lies within the triangle, alpha, beta, and gamma will all be positive.
		alpha 	= ((p2.y-p3.y)*(p.x-p3.x)+(p3.x-p2.x)*(p.y-p3.y))/((p2.y-p3.y)*(p1.x-p3.x)+(p3.x-p2.x)*(p1.y-p3.y))
				= ((40-50)  *  (20-20)  + (20-30)  *  (40-50))  / ((40-50)  *  (10-20)  +  (20-30)  *  (20-50))
				= (-10*0 + -10*-10) / (-10*-10 + -10*-30)
				= (0+100) / (100+300)
				= 1/4 > 0
				true

		beta 	= ((p3.y-p1.y)*(p.x-p3.x)+(p1.x-p3.x)*(p.y-p3.y))/((p2.y-p3.y)*(p1.x-p3.x)+(p3.x-p2.x)*(p1.y-p3.y))
				= ((50-20)  *  (20-20)  + (10-20)  *  (40-50))  / ((40-50)  *  (10-20)  +  (20-30)  *  (20-50))
				= (30*0 + -10*-10) / 400
				= 1/4 > 0
				true

		gamma	= 1 - alpha - beta
				= 1/2 > 0
				true

		Alpha, beta, and gamma are all greater than zero. Therefore, p lies in the triangle.
